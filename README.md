- ⚡ Fun fact: If Gravity were slightly more powerful, then the universe would collapse into a ball. If Gravity were slightly less powerful, there would be no stars or planets. It’s just that gravity is precisely as strong as it needs to be. And if the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the strong force wasn’t 1%, life wouldn’t exist. What are the odds it would happen all by itself? It is logical to conclude that there is a creator.
